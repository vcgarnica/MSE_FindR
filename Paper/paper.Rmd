# Summary

Research synthesis methods such as meta-analysis rely on either individual participant
data or appropriate summary statistics for implementation. A commonly encountered problem is when a measurement of variability is not explicitly included among the summary statistics in published studies, leading to potential publication bias and loss of statistical power from having to omit otherwise credible research from analysis. `MSE FindR` is a user-friendly R shiny web app tool for estimating the pooled variance $\hat\sigma^2$ in ANOVA type studies, contingent on the study designs being balanced and randomized. It does so by using commonly reported information such as treatment means, $\alpha$ significance level, number of replicates, and post hoc test results to obtain an estimate of $MSE$ for each study. Users upload a CSV file containing the relevant information reported in the study, then specify the experimental design (Latin square, completely randomized, randomized complete block, two-way factorial, and split-plot designs) as well as the post hoc test (Fisher's LSD, Tukey’s HSD, Scheffé’s, and multiple comparison tests with Bonferroni or Šidák corrections) applied in the analysis of underlying data. `MSE FindR` then proceeds with that information to obtain an estimate of $MSE$, that can subsequently be used to calculate variability measurements required in meta-analysis. Validation testing demonstrated a moderate to strong correlation (0.440 $\leq$ $\rho$ $\leq$ 0.996) between variance estimated during ANOVA and that obtained when treatment means and post hoc tests were submitted to `MSE FindR` algorithms. With this tool, researchers can conveniently obtain an estimate of variability from published summary reports, enabling the inclusion of studies in future quantitative review of research data.


# Statement of need

In many cases involving the synthesis of quantitative research, researchers have limited access to the data that were used in each individual study to generate the reported summary information or statistics. When data and statistical procedures are fully available, validation and replication of research results can be conducted, and the reuse of existing research data can further enhance future inferential analysis (e.g., of a product’s efficacy assessed across multiple independent studies).

When the individual study data are absent, standard meta-analytic approaches rely on reported metrics such as the mean and some measure of variability (either the standard deviation, variance, or standard error values for each treatment group [@Higgins2011]. A common problem arises when either none of these critical variability metrics are explicitly included in the published report, or can be directly estimated from supporting information in the report. In such situations, the systematic reviewer can choose either omit the trial from the meta-analysis, which generates additional concerns over the introduction of potential bias and loss of precision; or alternatively, estimate the missing variance information based on other information embedded in the report [@Weir2018]. Supporting information included in agricultural journal articles are typically Fisher’s least significant difference value (LSD), Tukey’s honest significant difference value (HSD), the coefficient of variation (CV), and the p-value, among others. 

One of the assumptions in ANOVA is that the variance is constant across the treatment groups and the pooled variance ($\hat\sigma^2$; i.e., $MSE$) is an unbiased estimate of the population variance ($\sigma^2$). Note that $MSE$ is a single value that describes the assumed common variability of all treatments and is equivalent to the residual variance ANOVA type studies. Given the $MSE$, one can of course then calculate the standard deviation, a critical metric used in quantitative research synthesis [@Koricheva2013]. Herein, $MSE$ and $\hat\sigma^2$ will be used interchangeably. 


Post hoc tests (also known as means separation or multiple comparison tests) are extensively used in the analysis of randomized trials in agricultural research studies. In post hoc procedures, the pairwise mean differences are compared against a test statistic, which is based (in part) on $\hat\sigma^2$. For any study with a significant post hoc test within a collection of means, the actual value of a test statistic, Fisher's LSD for example, ranges between the largest nonsignificant difference and the smallest significant difference of the treatment means. @Ngugi2011 outlined this concept and proposed a method to obtain $\hat\sigma^2$ from trials with missing estimates of variability by computing values of these finite boundaries above and averaging them for a parameter called estimated LSD (ELSD), in Fisher’s LSD procedure. The ELSD is then used in the respective post hoc test formula where the $\hat\sigma^2$ is to be estimated.

Building on this concept, `MSE FindR` was developed to quickly obtain an estimate of $\hat\sigma^2$ from ANOVA studies with missing variability metrics that, alternatively, report treatment means, post hoc tests, and other basic information. The tool is equipped with a variety of post hoc tests (Fisher's LSD, Tukey’s HSD, Bonferroni and Šidák correction for multiple comparisons, and Scheffé’s test obtained from `agricolae`, `emmeans`, and `multcomp` R packages) and experimental designs commonly used in agricultural sciences.



# Software implementation

`MSE FindR` uses an intuitive interface that guides the user through the analysis (Figure 1). In its current version, the tool comprises four main modules (Disclosure, Upload file, Separate means and letters, and Estimator) and supports the estimation of $\hat\sigma^2$ for post hocs and experimental designs in Table 1.

# Performance

In order to access `MSE FindR` robustness, we simulated 5000 trials containing individual participant across each experimental design supported by the tool. Simulations were performed with $\alpha$ set at 0.05 and varying treatment effects sizes, levels for A and B (in parenthesis, when applicable), and replicates or blocks (3 to 5 – except Latin square). Each trial containing individual participant was then submitted to ANOVA and subsequently, $\hat\sigma^2$ was extracted for future comparisons. Treatment means and post hoc results were obtained for trials with significant treatment effect, based on ANOVA results, which were submitted, along with expecific experimental design information, to `MSE FindR` algorithms. Table 2 presents Pearson’s correlation coefficients between $\hat\sigma^2$ obtained from ANOVA and `MSE FindR` for experimental designs, treatment structure, and post hoc tests supported by the tool.

A strong agreement between $\hat\sigma^2$ obtained from ANOVA and MSE FindR was observed for one-way designs or 2-way designs when both factors A and B, or similarly, A × B are included. Conversely, less agreement is observed for two-way designs with one factor omitted from the analysis, due to the limited information available to estimate $\hat\sigma^2$ (Table 2 and Figure 2). It should be noted that the precision of $\hat\sigma^2$ estimation increases as the number of levels in the factor of interest increases (data not shown).

# Conclusions

`MSE FindR` is a user-friendly interface that facilitates the extraction of pooled variance from manuscripts lacking measurement of variability and which, alternatively, report treatment means, post hoc tests, and other commonly available information in scientific reports. We aim to continue to expand `MSE FindR` functionalities by incorporating new experimental designs and post hoc tests.
